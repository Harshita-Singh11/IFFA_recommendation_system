2,Al Bangeri,,Oman,IFFA1003,"Haseena, the protagonist of our film, a widow who has recently emerged from her mourning period. She used to derive her value from her husband's status, as he was the respected and followed wise man and healer of the neighborhood by its residents.

Haseena felt threatened after her husband’s death. The value she derived from her husband’s status had disappeared, and she became merely the healer’s widow who could not provide anything to the residents of the neighborhood as her husband had done. This is what prompted her to cling to the Banjari (Banjari mean bracelet in Arabic) that was pressed into her hand by a woman who had gone through the same experience.

However, each time the Banjari gave her greater power and made her perform strange rituals that would give her the ability to help the desperate residents, it also took a significant part of her, which was one of her fingers. It forced her to cut off one finger after another. This symbolizes the human desire to prove their false worth despite the harm they may endure and the sacrifices they make from their essence and truth. The greed for status blinds us even to the reality of our being and makes us undervalue ourselves.

Haseena clings to the Banjari until it becomes a burden on her, causing her more harm than good. She begins to fear for herself and seeks a way out and a solution to get rid of it. She remembers that she can only get rid of it by giving it to a woman she considers a victim of it as she was a victim of others. However, she fails at the last moment due to the surprise that will become clear at the end of the film.

In the end, each of us has our own ""Banjari"" in life, it could be a name, tribe, status, appearance, or something else. Without realizing it, we try in various ways to cling to it, to feel our worth. Once we get rid of it, we realize our true value, which comes from within. The more we try to deny this truth and seek other sources to enhance our worth, the more we'll have to strip away parts of ourselves each time, until our reality becomes distorted, and we no longer recognize ourselves.",00:25:11,Oman,Arabic,Oman,"Drama, Short Film",No,Black magic 12k,32,Color,Moosa Nasser Alkindi,Haleema Ahmed Alka'abi,Muneer Khalfan Al Rawahi,,,,International Short Film,"Qade Film Festival

6,SEX FOR SURVIVAL,,United States,IFFA1007,"Venezuela represents the country with the largest number of displaced people in the world, even above Syria and Ukraine.

In this context, a renowned Venezuelan journalist, Luis Olavarrieta, decides to undertake a complex and unique journey, which begins in his homeland (Caracas, Venezuela), and whose main objective is to investigate the very complex problems experienced daily by thousands of displaced Venezuelans who have been forced to prostitute themselves to survive.

During his time in Cúcuta, Maicao and New York, Luis Olavarrieta will show us all the edges of this very sensitive issue that includes, among other things: need, desperation, aberrations, sexual diseases, violation of human rights, injustices, and human trafficking.

In a very intimate and sincere tone, Luis will try to understand and explain the reasons why, more than an activity of “Prostitution” it is a much deeper and more complex issue that is already known in the world as “Sex for Survival”.",01:00:43,United States,Spanish,"Colombia, United States, Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of",,No,4K,32,Color,Jorge Antonio Gonzalez,Marcos Salas,"Jorge Antonio Gonzalez, Luis Olavarrieta",Luis Olavarrieta,,,International Documentary,

To regain control, 1488 hits the button as a final attempt to escape his horror. The parole Officer carefully watches every move through surveillance cameras. Having survived the white torture, the parole interview begins with standard discussions on redemption and methodology but rapidly moves to increasingly personal inquiries.

39,The Darkside of SOCIETY,,,IFFA1040,"In 1989, Brian Yuzna’s SOCIETY was barred from a US release but resonated with audiences commercially and critically throughout Europe, particularly in the U.K. The film instantly became a cult-classic and its audacity has lived on through the years.
It has been analyzed and discussed all over social media with numerous video shows breaking down the structure, tone and satire and comparing it to other works on class warfare in society.  Packing stomach-churning gore and thought-provoking social commentary in equal measure, Society was a biting horror satire culminating in one of the most gag-inducing “climaxes”’ in all of horror history.   It has been considered a bona fide cult classic that continues to be watched, relished and enjoyed year after year to the delight of many.  
However, little to nothing is known about the film’s origins and the original screenplay. And that is until screenwriter Zeph E. Daniel, formerly known as Woody Keith, stepped out of his closet-of-dark-secrets and told the incredible story behind this morbid, subversive oddity of a film.  And the underlying truth that it was based on certain real-life events as horrific and outrageous as the actual story.  In this case truth and fiction unite.

61,RAMNAMI : In Search Of Lord Ram (ENGLISH),,,IFFA1062,"Chhattisgarh is known as the Mother state of India. It has been the center of development of various cultures since the Vedic and mythological times. The sacred, virtuous, and life-giving river Mahanadi originates from the Sihawa region of this state. Mahanadi is also mentioned in the texts of Ramayana and Mahabharata period. Here it is also called Chitrotpala Ganga because many ancient cities and temples are situated on the banks of this river as sacred as the Ganges. Even today its ruins indicate that centuries ago there was an influence of Vaishnav, Shaiva, Shakta, and Buddhist cultures here.

Moving from Sihawa, Mahanadi plays an important role in developing the agricultural culture along with the divine culture on both its banks. As this river, flowing from south to north, moves forward from Dhamtari and reaches Baloda Bazar and Janjgir district, on both its ends, glimpses of diverse cultures begin to be seen, in which life, culture, and tradition are visible one after the other. Spirituality and philosophy, all three get integrated. With the flow of time, many cultures were born on the banks of Mahanadi; Among them, the rebellious culture of Ramnamis occupies the highest place.

What a wonderful style these Ramnamis have..! Ram in the mind, Ram in the body, and Ram in every pore..! Ram in breath, Ram in hope, Ram in every endeavor of life..! For them, Ram is not just an ordinary name; he is not just a godlike great man born as the son of King Dasharatha in Tretayuga; they are an integral part of their conscious culture and common life. Ram is not just an excuse for their living; it is an essential condition for their living. Ram is not just a pretext for their survival; he is the complete synonym of their life. Ram in their life is like this:

jhaag-jhaag ke tan ko gheesen
raam mulamma naa chhootai.

Actually, Ram is their world, their afterlife; there is his worship, and also his worship. Perhaps that is why all the devotees of Ram speak only of Ram with every breath, speak to only Ram, talk only of Ram, talk only to Ram, they start with Ram and end with Ram only. Ram is in every fiber of their being, in every breath; Ram is the beginning of their life, remains throughout their life, and perhaps Ram does not leave them even after their life..!


That is why all the people of Ram worship only Ram, sing only Ram, cover themselves with Ram and lay down their bed only Ram. They belong only to Ram and want to remain Ram's only. They are ready to endure every hardship for Ram. But they cannot live without Ram even for a moment. In such a situation, how would Ram even be able to live without them? They are deeply filled with pain due to separation from Ram. In the words of Kabir, Ramnami wants to burn his entire body and turn it into paper, and on it, with the pen of his bones, write a letter of love in the name of Ram and send it to Ram:

yahu tan jaaroo masi karoo, likhahu raam ka naav.
lekhni karoo karank kee, likhi likhi raam pathau..

Seeing this style of separation of the Ramnami community, we should not be surprised at all as to why they have been awakening a different spiritual flame of Ramnaam in this soil of Chhattisgarh for more than 125 years. Yes..! One must be surprised as to why the Ramnamis, despite following Sanatan Dharma, did not look at any temple or worship any idol; And despite the sting, he remains a believer and a true devotee of Lord Ram. All the Lambardars in the mainstream of the society do not have the strength to call them atheists even by mistake; Because the devotion of the Ramnamis and above all their way of expression is amazing and unprecedented; There is opposition as well as rebellion in it; There is rebellion and also attachment..! There is both a desire to go away from loved ones and also a desire to stay together..!!

The real thing is that Ramnami Panth wants to tell the story of living life with self-respect in every situation, not only to its followers but also to all the forcibly marginalized communities across the world. It is perhaps possible for him to do this because once upon a time, the Ramnami sect itself, on behalf of the society called untouchables in the caste system of Sanatan Dharma, emerged with a very rebellious attitude against the so-called superiors.

It was founded around 1890 AD by a person named Parashuram from Chandli village of Chhattisgarh. As soon as this name comes to mind, the image of a hero fighting against atrocities always emerges. It seems as if Lord Parashurama, known as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu in Hinduism, was prophesied to appear at a time of great evil and put an end to the tyranny of his time. Similarly, Parashuram, the founder of Ramnami Samaj, appeared as a savior against the prevailing evils in society at that time. The only difference was that this time Parashuram was not born in a high clan but in a low clan, so his challenges were a bit unusual and the winds extremely adverse. But even this time, Parashuram did not accept defeat. Remembering him, Jameel Mazhari Saheb comes to mind involuntarily:

jalaane vaale jalaate hee hain charaag aakhir.
ye kya kaha ki hava tez hai zamaane kee.

Parashuram came as an incarnate man who blossomed even in the midst of all kinds of storms.

In fact, even before the birth of Parashuram, the groundwork for his movement had started. During the Bhakti movement in the medieval period, there came a time when the people of the so-called upper community in the varna system forcibly took control of all the Aaradhyas. In this snatching and grabbing, no deity could come into the hands of the untouchable section of society. It would have been better if matters had stopped here! The limit was reached when the upper-caste people declared these Scheduled Caste people untouchable and banned them from entering the temple. They were also human beings! Their souls also yearned to meet their God.

Parashuram was not allowed to enter the temple one day because of his low caste. This incident hurt Parashuram deeply. He rebelled against the religion for which he used to stand in service around the clock, he gave up temple and idol worship in that moment and wore Ramnami robes. He went around telling everyone he met that there was no need to go to the temple to worship Ram. Lord Ram is not present in any temple or idol but in every human being and in all of nature. Our body is the biggest temple in which Ram himself resides. Ram is a resident of Ghat-Ghat. They need to search within rather than outside. To show his resistance, he got Ram-Ram tattooed all over his body and dedicated himself to Ram.

Parashuram was not the only victim in the area at that time; many like him had silently suffered this social contempt for a long time. Therefore, when Parashuram showed his rebellious form, his words deeply impacted the morale of the society known as untouchable, and under his influence, the people of the nearby villages also got Ram-Ram tattooed on their bodies like him. Their belief behind writing Ramnaam was that after death, Ram would recognize them in the afterlife.

It is said that at that time many people, angry because Ram-Ram was written on their forehead and body, attacked Ramnamis; He was burnt with hot rods to erase his Ram-Ram tattoo; The clothes were set on fire. But how could anyone erase Ram-Ram from his heart? There came a time when the ancestors of Ramnamis had to make rounds of the courts because of taking the name of Ram. He was accused by the practitioners of religion that by taking the name of Ram, the name of Ram was being defiled.


Ramnami was also not going to accept defeat..! On his part, he argued in the court that the Ram whom we chant is not Ram, the son of King Dasharatha of Ayodhya, but he is the Ram who is present in everything. We have nothing to do with Sagun Ram. That Ram which becomes impure just by our chanting, cannot be our Ram. After the hearing, the Sessions Judge of Raipur finally ruled that since Ramnami was neither entering anyone's temple nor worshiping Hindu symbols. In such a situation, they cannot be stopped from their religious activities.


The confidence of the Ramnamis towards their Ram was unshakable. Gradually the Ramnamis developed separate worship methods and rituals for their sect, which have now become a special part of their common life. Prominent among these are - accepting Ramayana and Ramcharitmanas as major scriptures, developing Bhajan Khamb or Jaitkhamb as a place of worship, getting the name of Ram-Ram tattooed on the body, wearing a blanket with Ram-Ram written in black color on white cloth. To do this, wear a crown made of peacock feathers and sing bhajans while playing ghungru.


Ramnami starts his day by singing hymns of Lord Rama. While singing bhajans, they also read Ramayana and Ramcharitmanas but they do not consider Dashrath's son Ram as a deity. They believe that even when Dasharatha's son Ram was not born, Ram was still there. They believe in Saint Raidas according to whom:

raidaas hamaaro raam jee, dasharath kai sut naahi.
raam hamyo maahi rahayo, bisab kutumbahi maahi.

Like all saint poets, Raidas's Ram was also Nirguna Ram. And Ram of Ramnaamis is also Nirguna. All Ramnamis consider Ramayana and Ramcharitmanas as their main scriptures. Although they accept only those parts of it in which the glory of the name has been mentioned and things have been said about bringing harmony in the society. They leave out those parts of these texts which promote caste system and discrimination.

The first symbol that the Ramnami sect adopted for its worship was Jaitakhamb or Vijayastambh. Jaitkhamb is a pillar made of wood or cement installed on a platform which is painted white and on which a white flag is hung. The name Ramram has been written several times on it in black colour. A big bhajan fair is started by offering Kalash and flag on Jaitkhamb. Sitting in this, Ramnami saints perform bhajans and conduct their meetings.

Starting from morning greetings, Ramnami starts every work with Ram-Ram. Many types of Ramnami live in this society. Those Ramnamis who get the name Ram tattooed on any one part of their body are called 'Ramnami' and those who get two words Ram name tattooed on their forehead are called 'Shiromani Ramnami'. The one who gets Ram's name written on the entire forehead is called 'Sarvang Ramnami' and the one who gets Ram's name written on every part of the body is called 'Nakhshikh Ramnami'. Nakhshikh Ramnami does not leave any part of his body unwritten. They even get Ram-Ram written on their genitals, eyelids, ears and tongue.

Ramnami people start the practice of tattooing the name of Ram on the body of their child as a ritual from the very birth of their child. They celebrate Chhathi on the sixth day of the birth of their children. On the same day, the name of Ram is inscribed on the child's forehead for the first time. However, Ram's name can be inscribed on the child's body when he turns five years old or at the time of his marriage.

Ramnami Odhni is the traditional dress of men and saints of this society. Women also cover themselves in the same way. The name Ramram is written in black color on these covers. The entire Odhni is completely filled with innumerable repetitions of the Name. Sometimes Ramnami Odhni looks like a wonderful painting composed of calligraphy done in black color on white cloth. Ramnami himself makes this natural ink. This ink is used in chanting the name of Ram, in worship and also in tattooing the name of Ram on the body.


Peacock crowns are also very important in Ramnami society. Both men and women wear peacock crowns. Those wearing the crown are symbols of Ramnami's renunciation of lust. They stay far away from a life full of lust. Common Ramnamis wear this crown only during mass bhajan. Those who leave family life always wear the peacock crown named Ramnaami. However, at the time of sleeping, it is removed and kept wrapped in a thin white cloth and placed at the place of worship. 


Apart from the peacock crown, Ghunghrus also have great importance in Ramnami society. Ramnami wraps the Ghunghrus around his hands, hits them on the ground, and plays them rhythmically. The notable thing is that these Ghunghrus are made by Ramnami himself. They tie ghunghrus to their feet and sing bhajans while dancing and moving to the mesmerizing rhythm. The bhajan sabha, wearing anklets and anklets, usually starts at night and continues until morning. The purpose of making the sound of Ghunghroo as the only musical instrument at night is probably to create a transcendental effect in devotion.


With the passage of time, many Ramnamis' shrines have developed in this area, the most prominent of which is Shivrinarayan. Shivrinarayan holds the same importance in the lives of Ramnamis as Prayag and Kashi do for others in Hindu religion. During the fair held on Maghi Purnima, people of this sect put up a tent with their name of Ram written in Shivrinarayan and perform bhajans, etc. However, besides Shivrinarayan, fairs are also organized at other places, and almost every year the location of these fairs changes. In these fairs, seeing the procession of Ramnamis with Ram's name inscribed all over their bodies is the center of everyone's attraction. 


In its structure, the Ramnami sect is free from any kind of religious ostentation and hypocrisy. Perhaps that is why there is no tradition of Pandit or Mahant in their events. Ramnami does not call any Pandit for the marriage. Only the people from the boy's and girl's sides stand in front of Jaitkhamb. For the wedding, the bride and groom take seven rounds around Jaitkhamb. After this, people from both sides offer some money on Ramcharitmanas. Marital dakshina is given to the bride and groom. Then the elders of the society bless them.


There are four types of Ramnami – Brahmachari, Tyagi, Vanaprasthi and Sanyasi. A celibate does not marry throughout his life. Tyagi are those who marry and live together, but do not have physical relations. Tyagi women also give up vermilion and bindi and get the name of Ram written in their place. She removes bangles, mangalsutra and jewelery and wears jewelery with Ram's name written on it. At the same time, Vanaprasthi also gets married and gives birth to a child. Their life is like that of ordinary people. Whereas the monks go to the forests to perform penance.

Contrary to the traditional belief of Sanatan Dharma, Ramnamis do not burn the dead bodies of their relatives after death, but instead merge them with the Panchatatva. They believe that they cannot see the name of Ram burning in front. Here, the dead body is not buried after sunset and it is kept in the same room where the rest of the family sits. The dead person is bathed regularly before burial. Turmeric paste is applied on his body and then he is taken to the designated place for cremation on a bamboo saddle, wearing a new white loincloth, while singing hymns in the name of Ram.


Generally in Hindu society, Sutak is observed on the death of someone and people do not do any auspicious work during this time. But Ramnami does not mourn anyone's death. When Ramnami himself went to seek refuge in Ram, then what is there to mourn? On this day too, like every other day, good food is cooked here, everyone eats food like any other day. All their daily work is done in the same way as it was done on normal days.


Today's Ramnami society is going through a period of crisis. Its first crisis is internal. The new generation of Ramnami society is avoiding getting Ram's name tattooed on their entire body. In fact, the new generation, after getting educated, has started moving to different places of the country in search of employment. For one thing, tattooing is banned in many jobs. Secondly, the youth of the new generation Ramnaami community may not like to be seen as a wonder all their life by having Ram's name permanently tattooed on their entire body.


The number of followers of Ramnami Samaj is not increasing much despite all efforts. Today's crisis of purity of conduct and restraint in life prevents new people from adopting this sect. Ramnami himself allows only those with a very pure life to join his society. Therefore, the number of people adopting it is very low. This indicates that this sect is growing with great hesitation, barely at the genetic level. If this is the case, a time may come when the existence of Ramnami Samaj will gradually come to an end. And it is not impossible at all. 


The third crisis facing the Ramnamis is external. Despite all the struggle of the Ramnamis who have kept their caste pride at bay, the ghost of untouchability has still not been completely eradicated from this area. Even now, all kinds of highs and lows exist here as before. Ramnami himself also becomes a victim of this squid from time to time. In such a situation, when the Ramnami movement is unable to free itself and the people around it from the bondage of their caste, then the people who were already marginalized in the caste system, despite all their inertia, are living their lives in the same situation. They do not want to take any new risks for themselves in this life. 


Despite this, the contribution of Ramnami Samaj cannot be forgotten so easily. Due to its revolutionary thoughts and rebellious attitude, in the pretext of religious and caste consciousness in the banks of river Mahanadi, it has awakened the flame of living with self-respect within every human being, without caring for anyone, and its fire has shown light to this area for centuries. Will continue to work. Truth be told, now this region needs a new Parashuram who can identify afresh the germs hidden at the root of the rotten social system that has changed its form with time and lead a new type of bloodless revolution against them. So that the roots of caste discrimination can be eliminated from this area and the pride and self-respect of the individual can be restored. It should be hoped that one day, a new Parashuram will be born from among these Ramnamis. A couplet by Sahir Ludhianvi comes to mind:

Designed to be a simple rock collector on Mars, our hero instead spends his days fantasizing about Earthly adventures—cruising down Route 66, basking in Adriatic sunsets, and escaping from dinosaurs. His dreams are fueled by the snippets of human stories he absorbed in the lab, unbeknownst to his creators.

Mars, with its barren landscapes and monotonous tasks, proves a disheartening prison for his vibrant imagination. One morning, after a particularly disappointing Martian sunset previous night, he decides to take destiny into his own circuits...

Tweenbot's journey becomes an adventure of unexpected challenges and discoveries that push him to his limits. His quest for identity and belonging is underscored by the evocative song ""Find Myself,"" penned by renowned lyricist Katie Cole and performed by the soulful Joe Borowsky, capturing the essence of his odyssey with the line, ""sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself.""

""Tweenbot"" is a tale of rebellion and self-discovery, a modern-day Les Misérables set against the backdrop of the stars.
